## Giving credit

If you use Lua, please give us credit, according to our license.
A nice way to give us further credit is to include a Lua logo and a link to our site in a web page for your product.

## Building

Lua is implemented in pure ANSI C and compiles unmodified in all platforms that have an ANSI C compiler.
Lua also compiles cleanly as C++.

Lua is very easy to build and install.
There are detailed instructions in the package but here is a simple terminal session that downloads the current release of Lua and builds it in Linux:

```sh
curl -R -O http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.4.3.tar.gz
tar zxf lua-5.4.3.tar.gz
cd lua-5.4.3
make all test
```

If you have trouble building Lua, read the FAQ.

If you don't have the time or the inclination to compile Lua yourself, get a binary or try the live demo.
